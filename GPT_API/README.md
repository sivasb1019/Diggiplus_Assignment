# Generating a project proposal using the GPT-3 language model provided by OpenAI. 



# 1. Importing Libraries:

  The code begins by importing the necessary Python libraries, including os, openai, and time. Be sure that you install the required libraries from **"requirements.txt"**.

  
# 2. Setting Up OpenAI API Key:

  It sets up the OpenAI API key by fetching it from an environment variable using os.getenv. You need to set this environment variable with your actual OpenAI API key for the code to work.
  
  
# 3. Defining the GPT-3 Model:

  The GPT-3 model to be used for text generation is specified as 'text-davinci-002'.

  
# 4. Configuration for Prompts:

  The code defines a dictionary called PROMPTS with different sections of a project proposal (e.g., Objectives, Approach, Schedule, Resources, etc.) and associated prompts to be used for generating content in those sections.

  
# 5. Function to Interact with GPT-3:

  There's a function called generate_text that interacts with the GPT-3 model using OpenAI's API. It takes a prompt, model, and optional max_tokens as parameters and returns generated text.
  
  
# 6. Creating a Project Proposal:

  The create_project_proposal function is defined to create a project proposal. It generates content for each section defined in PROMPTS and inserts an introductory section with project details.
  
  
# 7. Main Execution:

  The code then defines project details in a dictionary (project_details) with information like the project title, duration, goals, roles, challenges, and success metrics.
  
  It calls the create_project_proposal function to generate content for each section based on the prompts and project details.
  
  Finally, it prints each section title and content, adding a 2-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limits.
